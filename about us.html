        <h1>Brief History of the Organisation</h1>
        <p><i>
            Café Botanika began as a dream shared by two friends who loved coffee, nature, and living sustainably. 
            In 2024, that dream came to life, sparked by a trip to the Cape Winelands, where they found themselves enchanted 
            by the peaceful charm of botanical gardens and cozy artisanal cafés.
            <br><br>
            Back in Cape Town, they set out to create a space that felt just as calming and inspiring. 
            The result? A beautiful little café tucked into one of the city’s trendiest suburbs, where café culture meets 
            lush greenery and plant-based design.
            <br><br>
            Today, Café Botanika is more than just a coffee spot—it’s a local gem. People come for the floral-filled interiors, 
            stay for the small-batch herbal drinks, and often leave with a handcrafted botanical good or a new plant baby 
            from one of the mini workshops. It’s a place where nature and community bloom together.

        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
            At Café Botanika, our mission is to create a sanctuary where coffee, nature, and conscious living come together. 
            We’re here to serve thoughtfully crafted drinks in a space that inspires calm, connection, and a deeper appreciation 
            for the botanical world.
        </p>

        <!-- Vision statement -->
        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>
            At Café Botanika, we envision becoming South Africa’s most beloved floral-themed café brand—an inspiring destination 
            where nature, wellness, and creativity flourish together. 
            Our goal is to lead the way in sustainable café culture by blending botanical beauty with mindful living, offering spaces 
            that feel like a breath of fresh air in the heart of the city.
            <br><br>
            We aspire to build a community rooted in connection, where every cup of coffee, herbal infusion, and handcrafted good 
            tells a story of care for the environment, for local artisans, and for the people we serve. 
            Through immersive plant-based experiences, wellness workshops, and eco-conscious design, we aim to spark joy, nurture 
            creativity, and promote a lifestyle that honours both self and planet.
            <br><br>
            Café Botanika is more than a café—it’s a movement toward greener, gentler living. 
            And we’re here to grow, bloom, and inspire—one leaf, one sip, one soul at a time.
